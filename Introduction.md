# About my-amic #

The aim of this project is to re-create the experience of running the aMIC computer. The main benefits are:
  * Exploring issues like data recovery (from old tapes), real-time Java, hardware emulation, etc.
  * Providing a sample of the "look and feel" of early home computers, for the benefit of younger generations
  * Providing a convenient way to run unique applications such as "VIS-Z80" and the BASIC samples from A. Petrescu (1984) book
  * Preserving endangered examples of software such as aMIC's firmware
