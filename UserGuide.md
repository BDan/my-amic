Sample BASIC program:
```
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD!"
20 FOR I=0 TO 10
30 PRINT "I IS: ";I
40 NEXT I
50 END
RUN
```
**Warning!** PC's _Back Space_ key is mapped to aMIC's "BS" which apparently does nothing, use _Delete_ instead.

From more information you'll need _A. Petrescu, 1985_ (volume 2) and/or _M. Patrubany, 1989_ book.
