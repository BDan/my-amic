==aMIC==
  * aMIC was a home computer designed and manufactured in Romania in 1983-1984
  * It was an original design, totally unrelated to the Sinclair Spectrum clones popular in the era.
  * It was built around the Z80 CPU, with a very simple architecture. The design started as a laboratory prototype at _Politechnica Institute_ in Bucharest.
  * Several configurations were produced, the most typical featuring "monitor" and BASIC interpretor.
    * _monitor_ was a minimalist piece of firmware allowing launching applications, raw memory view/edit and primitive debugger functions
    * The BASIC interpretor was also rather primitive (e.g. variables names can be only 2 character long) and targeted towards scientific applications, not entertainment and games (e.g. there was a built-in matrix operation library)
  * The computer, its hardware, principles of operation, programming, etc. were thoroughly documented in a two volume book (_A. Petrescu (1985)_), which was the first introduction to computing for many people
  * By late '80 _aMIC_ was considered obsolete, very few copies have survive to date
