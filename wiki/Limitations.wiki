#summary Limitations to my-amic

== Features ==
  * Implements the main hardware features of aMIC with enough accuracy to run original software like Z80-MONITOR and VISIBLE-Z80
  * Sound
  * 100% speed on most modern PC

== Limitations ==
  * Timing and real-time behaviour is not perfectly accurate, because hardware delay sources (e.g. video RAM access) are not emulated. We don't have any documentation, nor test suites to verify or implement those.

== Missing ==
  * Tape loading and saving 
    * saving might work, as the tape output bit is routed to audio-out
  * Saving and loading RAM snapshots
  * Reset and INT buttons
    * Just restart the emulator
  * Better documentation, esp. keyboard map
